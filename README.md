# Algo

This repository contains several algorithms implemented by myself over the years. The implementations were developed as part of 
my personal learning and understanding process of various algorithmic concepts. For this reason, the main objective was clarity
rather than efficiency. 

If you happen to find any bugs, feel free to either open a PR or an issue.

If you have any questions/doubts regarding (some of) the implementations, open an issue and I will gladly respond :)
